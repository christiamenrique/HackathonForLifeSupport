Hackathon Teams! Time to get your 'Game On'. Here is a summary of instructions for your project:
1. Each team will make a single submission. Submissions are due by Thursday 5pm

2. Toni will send out the form to submit the url for your github repo. The github repo should be professionally composed, with the url for the working app embedded in the repo

3. The working app should be deployed to Heroku
4. Your README in your github should describe your app, and should include the names of all members of your team

5. Be creative! Bring a data model that serves the need fo LifeSports. Deliver an engaging UI. Has your team thought about analytics (a web page that displays some simple stats about the students workouts for a week or a day)? Take a look on npm at chartjs ... or react-chartjs-2

6. Remember that time management is critical. Anything you are not able to complete move it to a Futures chart and make it part of your pitch
